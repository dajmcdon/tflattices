	abstract = {Increases in the frequency, severity and duration of temperature extremes are anticipated in the near future. Although recent work suggests that changes in temperature variation will have disproportionately greater effects on species than changes to the mean, much of climate change research in ecology has focused on the impacts of mean temperature change. Here, we couple fine-grained climate projections (2050{\textendash}2059) to thermal performance data from 38 ectothermic invertebrate species and contrast projections with those of a simple model. We show that projections based on mean temperature change alone differ substantially from those incorporating changes to the variation, and to the mean and variation in concert. Although most species show increases in performance at greater mean temperatures, the effect of mean and variance change together yields a range of responses, with temperate species at greatest risk of performance declines. Our work highlights the importance of using fine-grained temporal data to incorporate the full extent of temperature variation when assessing and projecting performance.},

	abstract = {In 2001, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty suggested a dual characterization of the Bregman projection onto linear constraints, which has already been applied by Collins, Schapire, and Singer to boosting algorithms and maximum likelihood logistic regression. The proof provided by Della Pietra et al. is fairly complicated, and their statement features a curious nonconvex component. In this note, the Della Pietra et al. characterization is proved differently, using the powerful framework of convex analysis. Assuming a standard constraint qualification, the proof presented here is not only much shorter and cleaner, but it also reveals the strange nonconvex component as a reformulation of a convex (dual) optimization problem. Furthermore, the setting is extended from an affine subspace to a translated cone, and the convex function inducing the Bregman distance is only required to be Legendre. Various remarks are made on limitations and possible extensions.},
