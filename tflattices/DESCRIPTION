Description: This package uses a linearized alternating direction method of
    moments algorithm to estimate the natural parameter for a univariate
    exponential family distribution observed over a grid. The loglikelihood
    is augmented with a trend filter penalty of arbitrary order and optionally
    a penalty on the null space of the TF operator. The grid is allowed to wrap
    as a cylinder if desired.
